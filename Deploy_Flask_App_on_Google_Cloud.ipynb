        "In this lecture, we will containerize the Flask app that we developed in the previous lecture using Docker. We will then deploy the Docker container on Google Cloud. Here are the steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Setup a project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the $50 credit provided to you.\n",
        "2. Install Docker Desktop version\n",
        "3. Install gcloud CLI\n",
        "4. Containerize your Flask App using Docker and deposit to Google Artifact Registry\n",
        "5. Create a bucket in Google Cloud Storage to store the SQLite database\n",
        "6. Deploy the Flask App to Google Cloud using Cloud Run\n",
        "\n",
        "We will run our Flask app using Google Cloud Run and the SQLite database that our Flask app interacts with will be stored in a bucket in Google Cloud Storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Cloud Run\n",
        "Cloud Run is a Google Cloud service for running containers without needing to manage the infrastructure. It comes in two flavors: services and jobs. Services are containers which respond to HTTP requests and are well suited to hosting web servers and API's. Jobs perform a task to completion such as batch processing. Cloud Run is stateless and you pay only for what your container uses in memory and CPU. It also has a generous free tier which makes it even more attractive for getting started with.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Cloud Storage\n",
        "Cloud Storage is Google Cloud's object storage service. It's cheap, severless, and can store enormous amounts of data easily. Cloud Storage is quick and easy to retrieve objects, but it's optimized for quantity rather than high performance read and writes so it's slower than other Google storage services like Filestore or Persistent Disk which are designed to provide storage for applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Artifact Registry\n",
        "Google Artifact Registry is a service provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for storing and managing artifacts such as container images, Docker images, Maven/Gradle packages, and other software packages used in software development and deployment processes. It offers a secure and scalable solution for hosting and managing artifacts, providing features such as versioning, access control, vulnerability scanning, and integration with other Google Cloud services. Artifact Registry helps streamline the software development lifecycle by providing a centralized location for storing and sharing artifacts across teams and environments."
